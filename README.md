# ARDINO_PROJECT
Used this Project For National Level  Compitation in Dextor(for ppt presentation and made a small Demo Of Ardino 
Dustbin)
GitHub Desktop tutorial repository
          ARDINO DUSTUBIN, 5 Week(s)
In this project, I have designed a simple system called Smart Dustbin using Arduino, Ultrasonic
Sensor and Servo Motor, where the lid of the dustbin will automatically open itself upon detection of
human hand.
Â The main concept behind the smart dustbin usingÂ arduino project is object detction I have alredy
used altrsonic sensor in object avoiding robot.
A similar methodology is implimented here,where the altrsonic sensor is placed on top of the
dustbin's lid and when the sensor detctes any object like a human hand,it will triger arduino to open
the lidÂ .
